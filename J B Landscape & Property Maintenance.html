                Hi Daisy,
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a pleasure speaking with you today and getting to know more about J.B. Landscape & Property Maintenance. Thank you for sharing such a clear overview of your current processes and the challenges you're looking to overcome.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-bc-blue font-semibold">Summary of Call</h2>
            <p>
                We had a discussion about your business, which covers grounds maintenance, landscaping, and tree surgery. You're a growing company with six teams in the field, and your current systems are struggling to keep up with that growth. We explored how your day-to-day operations rely on a mix of different systems and manual paperwork, and how this is impacting efficiency and costing valuable time in the office.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-bc-blue font-semibold">Pain Points</h2>
            <p>
                Based on our conversation, we identified several key areas where your team is feeling the strain of disjointed processes.
            </p>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
                <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm flex items-start space-x-4">
                    <span class="text-3xl">üß©</span>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="font-bold mt-0 border-none pb-0">Disjointed Systems</h3>
                        <p class="mt-1">Your team currently uses separate systems for different tasks‚ÄîFastfields for worksheets, Word for quotes and invoices, and Excel for scheduling. This creates a lot of manual data entry and a "disjointed" process where systems "don't talk to each other."</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm flex items-start space-x-4">
                    <span class="text-3xl">‚è≥</span>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="font-bold mt-0 border-none pb-0">Time-Consuming Administration</h3>
                        <p class="mt-1">You mentioned that creating 50 invoices takes a "whole morning" and a single quote can take up to an hour. This is valuable time that could be spent on other tasks to help the business grow.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm flex items-start space-x-4">

                        <h3 class="font-bold mt-0 border-none pb-0">Limited Real-Time Visibility</h3>
                        <p class="mt-1">You're currently using paper timesheets and holiday request forms, which can get lost. You also can't easily see a live overview of who is in the office or where your teams are without them calling you.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm flex items-start space-x-4">

                        <h3 class="font-bold mt-0 border-none pb-0">Inefficient Equipment Tracking</h3>
                        <p class="mt-1">You have a spreadsheet to track tagged equipment, but it isn't live. It's difficult to know which team has what, or if an item is in the workshop, which can lead to wasted journeys.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <h3 class="font-bold mt-0 border-none pb-0">Ineffective Vehicle Tracking</h3>
                        <p class="mt-1">While you have vehicle trackers, you lack a system to automatically monitor and alert you to issues like speeding, which means you have no "proof" to act on.</p>

                </div>

                        <h3 class="font-bold mt-0 border-none pb-0">Remote Support Challenges</h3>
                        <p class="mt-1">Your current software provider is based in America, making it difficult to get support due to time differences.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
